# PhysiCalc
PhysiCalc is a calculating tool designed for physicists that has many capabilities including uncertainty calculations, automatic unit handling and conversion, and many built-in physical constants.


### Windows
PhysiCalc can be installed and run on Windows using the .exe installer under releases.

### Macintosh
Due to Apple's increasing strict limits on downloaded executables. I will not provide a bash script or installer for PhysiCalc.
The stand-alone .jar file can still be run from the terminal as shown below provided you have java installed.

## Execution from Terminal or Command Line
PhysiCalc can be run from the command line or terminal.

To run it open the command line or terminal and navigate to the folder containing the .jar file and type the command **java -jar physicalc-x.x.x.jar**.
