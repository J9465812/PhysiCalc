# PhysiCalc
PhysiCalc is a calculating tool designed for physicists that has many capabilities including uncertainty calculations, automatic unit handling and conversion, and many built-in physical constants.

## Execution
PhysiCalc must be run from the command line or terminal.

To run it open the command line or terminal and navigate to the folder containing the .jar file and type the command **java -jar physicalc-x.x.x.jar**. 
You may also use a script as described below. To terminate the program, press ctrl+c.

## Bash Script and Batch File
Provided in each release are files that allow you to execute PhysiCalc without first opening the command line or terminal.


### Windows
To run on Windows, download the physicalc-x.x.x.jar as well as the PhysiCalc.bat.
Place both of these files in the same directory.
Double-clicking on the batch file will automatically open the command prompt and run the program.

### Macintosh
Due to Apple's increasing strict limits on downloaded executables. I will not provide a bash script for PhysiCalc.
It can still be run from the terminal as shown above provided you have java installed.
