# PhysiCalc
PhysiCalc is a calculating tool designed for physicists that has many capabilities including uncertainty calculations, automatic unit handling and conversion, and many built-in physical constants.

## Execution
PhysiCalc must be run from the command line or terminal.

To run it open the command line or terminal and navigate to the folder containing the .jar file and type the command **java -jar physicalc-1.0.0.jar**.
To terminate the program, press ctrl+c.

## Bash Script and Batch File
Provided in each release are files that allow you to execute PhysiCalc without first opening the command line or terminal.
You may also use a script as described below.

### Windows
To run on Windows, download the physicalc-x.x.x.jar as well as the PhysiCalc.bat.
Place both of these files in the same directory.
Double-clicking on the batch file will automatically open the command prompt and run the program.

### Macintosh
To run on Mac, download the physicalc-x.x.x.jar and PhysiCalcBash.
Place both files on the desktop, and double-click on the bash file
to run PhysiCalc.

*NOTE: This might not work because of Apple's built-in protections
thinking it is malware. I am trying to find a way around it. Until then, just use the command line directly as described under Execution.*

## Opening the help page
After launching PhysiCalc, type "help" and press enter. PhysiCalc should bring up instructions to get started.
